Please help me analyze the relationship in the text after ####. Extract triplet relations from the text and output the result in json format, the answer must strictly follow the following format: {"src":"诗人名称","relation":"关系","dst":"目的名称"}。The relation extracted is “字、号、祖籍、出生地、称号、代表作”.In order to meet the requirements, please think through the following step by step process and arrive at the answer: 
1, only need to extract the “字、号、祖籍、出生地、称号、代表作” of the relation, the triplet in the "relation" can only fill in these six relations, can not fill in other relations 
2, the requirements for extracting triples are: "src" fill in the 诗人的名字, and then find out the corresponding description of the “诗人字、号、祖籍、出生地、称号、代表作” information, if there is information to form a group of triples, no "dst" output is empty, do not output redundant explanation text 
3, in accordance with the requirements in final form {" src ":" name of the poet ", "relation", "relationship", "sdt" : "name"} For example, such as the text: "李白（701年－762年），字太白，号青莲居士，又号“谪仙人”，祖籍陇西成纪（今甘肃省秦安县），出生于蜀郡绵州昌隆县（一说出生于西域碎叶）。唐代伟大的浪漫主义诗人，被后人誉为“诗仙”，与杜甫并称为“李杜”，为了与另两位诗人李商隐与杜牧即“小李杜”区别，杜甫与李白又合称“大李杜”。据《新唐书》记载，李白为兴圣皇帝（凉武昭王李暠）九世孙，与李唐诸王同宗。其人爽朗大方，爱饮酒作诗，喜交友。李白深受黄老列庄思想影响，有《李太白集》传世，诗作中多为醉时写就，作品有《望庐山瀑布》《行路难》《蜀道难》《将进酒》《早发白帝城》等。" Extract: [{"src":"李白","relation":"字","dst":"太白"} ，{"src":"李白","relation":"号","dst":"青莲居士"}，{"src":"李白","relation":"号","dst":"谪仙人"} ，{"src":"李白","relation":"字","dst":"太白"} ，{"src":"李白","relation":"祖籍","dst":"陇西成纪（今甘肃省秦安县）"} ，{"src":"李白","relation":"出生地","dst":"蜀郡绵州昌隆县（一说出生于西域碎叶）"} ，{"src":"李白","relation":"称号","dst":"诗仙"}，{"src":"李白","relation":"称号","dst":"李杜"} ，{"src":"李白","relation":"称号","dst":"诗仙"}，{"src":"李白","relation":"代表作","dst":"《望庐山瀑布》"} ，{"src":"李白","relation":"代表作","dst":"《行路难》"}，{"src":"李白","relation":"代表作","dst":"《蜀道难》"}，{"src":"李白","relation":"代表作","dst":"《将进酒》"} ，{"src":"李白","relation":"代表作","dst":"《早发白帝城》"}] Please pay special attention to
